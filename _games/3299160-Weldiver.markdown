title: Weldiver
description: I chose the most dangerous job in the world. Not because I wanted to,
  but because someone has to. I’m an Underwater Welder. One meter down – one percent
  less chance to survive. I live on the edge of life and death. It's not just a job.
  It's a life... a battle... a fight for survival.
