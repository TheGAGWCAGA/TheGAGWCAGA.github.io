  /><br>ASTROBOTANICA™ is a relaxed survival set on open-world prehistoric Earth.
  You are a highly educated extra-terrestrial named Xel, who crashed the spaceship
  when traversing the galaxy looking for precious seeds to bring them back home and
  feed your species. Now you have the chance to find varieties which would thrive
  on your planet, but first, you need to focus on surviving in the challenging Pleistocene
  environment of Earth, inhabited by wild animals and primal humans.<br><br>As alien
  botanist, you are well prepared to grow and process plants into food and medicine.
  But first you''ll have to learn how to properly take care of the unknown Earthly
  vegetation species, and how to make the best use of them. As your adventure unfolds,
  you''ll also meet Neanderthals, and will have to learn to communicate to earn their
  trust. At least air is clean and pristine in the prehistoric times, but as you do
  not breathe oxygen, you''ll have to figure out how to fulfill respiratory needs.<h2
