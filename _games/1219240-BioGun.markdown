reviews: "“BioGun looks like a fantastic voyage.”<br>Destructoid<br><br>“By making
  death potentially rewarding rather than punishing and leveraging the game's shooter-style
  combat system, BioGun manages to carve out a distinct identity in a genre saturated
  with sameyness.”<br>Game Rant<br><br>“BioGun is a sci-fi Metroidvania game with
  a fantastic premise.”<br>PCGamesN<br>"
