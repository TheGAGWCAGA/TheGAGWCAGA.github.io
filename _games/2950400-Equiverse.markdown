  /><br><br>Create and care for your unique ecosystem, filled with animals like rabbits

  grow and reap greater rewards over time! Use leafpoints to buy new animals and aquire

  ecosystem.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2950400/extras/61b15100a8388919f9f6acd8a0357f5d2-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?t=1725716889"

  /><br><br>Advance through levels by unlocking special chests with your leafpoints.
  Each chest contains a unique companion with special abilities to help you maintain
  your ecosystem. Strategize with up to three companions per level to maximize efficiency.

  leafpoint bonuses.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2950400/extras/ezgif-3-22eee66be5.gif?t=1725716889"
