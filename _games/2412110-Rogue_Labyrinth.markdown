about: Get this. You've been gone for 2 years and come back to find your peaceful

  colosseum labyrinth at the base of the largest Great Tree in the world! Now we're
  supposed to fight to become the next monarch of Lantanas?!<br><br>Battle up the
  ranks of the procedurally generated roguelite Labyrinth! Utilize hundreds of powers

  /><br>The Labyrinth shifts and changes every run, with different choices generating
  new and exciting maps. Roguelite levels are split into 4 biomes with 100s of different
  rooms you can encounter throughout your run, each based on the countries participating.

  own reasons for being there.<br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2412110/extras/g2.png?t=1728948208"

  each run, made different every time through given upgrades and choices. You can
