about: <h2 class="bb_tag">Those who are about to die salute you! </h2>In Gladiators
  of Citadelum, you will manage a warrior training camp in ancient Rome. Choose the
  best candidates to train them in different disciplines based on real roman gladiators.
  Set their routines, buy food and equipment to improve their chances in the arena.
  Defeat your rivals in epic fights in the most iconic amphitheaters spread throughout
  the Roman Empire.<h2 class="bb_tag">Endure the toughest training</h2>Every gladiator
  is unique. Buy only the best in the gladiator market, and train them in the fighting
  discipline that better suits their skills. You will want a strong candidate to become
  a heavy Murmillo, but perhaps you prefer the charismatic fighter that will earn
  you more denarii... if he survives.<h2 class="bb_tag">Prepare to draw blood</h2>Improve
  their chances of victory with a good training routine and a healthy diet. A balanced
  menu in the mess hall can give them a fighting boost, but don't overlook the importance
  of a good quality gladius! Buy armor and weapons and keep their equipment in good
  shape to give them an extra edge in combat. Heal their wounds and they may live
  long enough to cover you with fame and riches.<h2 class="bb_tag">Become a legend
  of Rome</h2>Your fighters will find glory or death in the arena. The people of Rome
  are thirsty for combat and gladiatorial games are scheduled regularly all across
  the Empire. Check the calendar and plan your training accordingly for the upcoming
  fights. The combat in Gladiators of Citadelum is class based, so you'll have to
  choose your roster wisely for each event. Once everything is set, gladiators will
  meet their destiny in intense battles, where only one shall be victorious. Will
  it be you?
