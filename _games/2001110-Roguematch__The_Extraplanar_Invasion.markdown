  notes:
about: 'Roguematch : The Extraplanar Invasion, is the daring fusion of a turn based
  Roguelike RPG, with a Match-3 grid layout, where the heroes brave through a castle
  full of raw magic and extra dimensional creatures. Watch carefully how your enemies
  move every turn. Plan to attack near with a physical strike, or far, with a burst
  of elemental magic when you fuse mana into groups. Every decision counts because
  as the clock ticks, more foes threaten to appear from strange portals in the walls.<br><br>The
  castle is on high alert though, and every room is on lockdown. Aside from defeating
  enemies, you will also have to deactivate the magical intruder alarm systems. Uncover
  sigils on the floor, blast crystals with mana and step on raised floor panels to
  clear the room. It''s strange however, because the castle defence system seems too
  elaborate to have been made to just keep out, lets say, just a Nekomancer from coming
  in to look for the Nekonomicon...<br><br>And, additional words of caution! Many
  of the rooms have been taken over by elemental forces. Be careful not to slide right
  into the lava from the Cryovolcanic Plane, and stay away from the superheated gas
  from the Elemental Plane of Steam. Remove the sticky floors from the Elemental Plane
  of Mud before you step in them. But what affects you...also affects your enemies!
  So lure them into traps when you have the chance.<h2 class="bb_tag">Game Features</h2><ul
  class="bb_ul"><li>Turn based combat in a grid based environment, with randomly generated
  level layouts and items. Set in a castle that seem to be overrun with creatures
  from the elemental planes of fire, air, earth and water realms and way beyond.<br><br></li><li>Elemental
  mana Match 3 system that lets you control the raw magic that has flooded the castle.
  Choose from six unique matching powers and change the way you play the game. Stop
  time and freeze enemies in their tracks with Time Pieces, or be a mana combo master
  with the Wildcard set. Create attack cats that shoot across the room or bomb pieces
  that cause chain explosions!<br><br></li><li>Six characters with different unique
  skills, strengths, and play styles. Binky as the speedy Bungeoneer, summon cats
  with the magical Nekomancer, or Shield Bash as the hardy Paladinu! Characters also
  have expertises that let them make more than one of some moves per turn!<br><br></li><li>Over
  100+ Spells and Items that change the way you handle challenges in the game. Many
  of them boost your stats or elemental damage, and also contain spells for you to
  cast! If you don''t have enough backpack space, discard the item but memorise the
  spells instead!<br><br></li><li> Face 20+ bosses from the elemental realms, each
  with their own attack patterns and weaknesses! Avoid the Orochill ice blasts! Break
  out of the Cementicore cement attacks! Dodge the Lavaiathan burning body ram!<br><br></li><li>Command
  the elemental environment to suit the situation. Expend mana and cause windy conditions,
  then match fire mana to create chain lightning! Or cause the room to turn into earthen
  surroundings and turn water mana into mud traps!<br><br></li><li>Play through a
  story that started out as a simple fetch quest between three friends that went really
  wrong, really bad, really fast!  </li></ul>'
