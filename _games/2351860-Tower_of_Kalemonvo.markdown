detailed_description: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Reinforcements are not coming. Resupply is impossible. Your ascent begins.</h2><br><strong>Tower of Kalemonvo</strong> is a challenging gothic Action RPG - following the slower pace and high tension seen in genre-defining classics like <i>Diablo 1</i> and <i>Throne of Darkness</i>. Defeat wicked foes, grow stronger, gather whatever loot you can find, and tread lightly - as every encounter could be your last! The fate of your realm hangs in the balance.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2351860/extras/classicarpg2.png?t=1731612588\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2351860/extras/gif4.gif?t=1731612588\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Randomly Generated Dungeon</strong><br>Rooms, rewards and foes are always changing. No two playthroughs will be the same.<br></li><li><strong>Classless Character Progression</strong><br>If you have the stats, you can equip any item, cast any spell or perform any combat feat.</li></ul><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2351860/extras/deepcustom2.png?t=1731612588\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2351860/extras/gif5.gif?t=1731612588\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Deep Itemization and Mystical Rare Items</strong><br>Loot is crucial to any ARPG worth its salt! The weapons and armor scattered around the <i>Tower</i> are enchanted with strange forces. From granting you skills and spells to hindering your stats, it's up to you to manage your inventory.<br></li><li><strong>Combat Arts and Item Skills</strong><br>Combat is about more than just <i>hacking and slashing</i>. Equipping a shield grants defensive skills to block or reflect projectiles or bash foes. Weapons come with their own distinct skills, from throwing two-handed scythes to ricochet arrows.</li></ul><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2351860/extras/brutaldiff2.png?t=1731612588\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2351860/extras/gif6.gif?t=1731612588\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Limited Resources</strong><br>The <i>Tower</i> is not for the faint of heart.
