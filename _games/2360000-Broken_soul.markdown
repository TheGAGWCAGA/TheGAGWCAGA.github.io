  relax.<br><br>But there is something wrong with the flat as well. There is a mess,
  there is a ready made lunch “From mom to Lisa”. Who is this Lisa? Alex heard a strange
  growling from inside the wardrobel, but there mustn’t anybody else in the flat?
  Well. But if there is someone else? The nightmare from the elevator has finished
  long ago. The real nightmare is just about tot start… As well as the struggle for
  the memories, the mind and even the life.
