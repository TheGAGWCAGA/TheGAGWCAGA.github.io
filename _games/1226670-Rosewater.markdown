reviews: "“Two of our favourite things about point-and-click adventure games have always been their capacity for storytelling and exploration, and Rosewater looks like it takes advantage of these strengths to provide players with the kind of experience that they can get lost in.”<br>Time Extension<br><br>“Rosewater looks gorgeous, and the writing is fun. The demo stops just as the real adventure gets started, and the full game’s potential ahead is as vast as the rolling plains and desert of this world. Definitely on our most wanted list.”<br>Adventures In Indie Gaming<br>"
