reviews: "“With a fantastical story that will quickly draw you in and plenty of detective
  work to be done, Echoes is an excellent visual novel that we struggled to put down.
  Its gorgeous art style, that changes as the story progresses, is simply the icing
  on the cake.”<br>8/10 – Gamespew<br>"
