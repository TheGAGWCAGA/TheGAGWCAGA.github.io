reviews: "“This isn’t a game of shades-of-gray moral choices, however; rather, lots
  of different creative ways to achieve your goals that can lead to all manner of
  interesting and delightful outcomes.”<br>PCGamesN<br><br>“Baladins is yet another
  indie experience destined to become beloved, and continues the long-held tradition
  of indies delivering more heartwarming, satisfying adventures than their AAA counterparts.”<br>GamingBible<br><br>“Seed
  by Seed’s newest game, Baladins, takes you on an addictive, choose-your-own-roleplaying
  adventure in the chaotic, fantastical land of Gatherac.”<br>Noisy Pixel<br>"
