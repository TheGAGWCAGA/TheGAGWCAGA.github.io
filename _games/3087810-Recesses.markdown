  notes:
about: <i>Recesses</i> is a card game, visual novel roguelite where every day's outdoor
  break from elementary school is a new battle. Your best friend went missing, and
  now it's up to you to defeat all the weirdo kids she played Battaliens with at recess
  to find out what happened to her.  <br><br><u><strong>In this game, losing is good!</strong></u>
  You get to see new dialogue, try new strategies, and win or lose, you always get
  another booster pack of cards to strengthen your collection.  <br><br>Making it
  all the way from Monday to the boss of the playground on Friday is no easy task,
  but each day's victory brings you closer to the truth. <i>Although it may not be
  what you expected.</i><br><br>Features:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Music by CoZyro
  and Kasey Ozymy (<i>Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass</i>) that will make you go, &quot;Wow!

  only <i>look</i> like they were drawn by a fifth grader. A grown up did draw them
  and he tried really hard. </li><li> 100 cards with unique abilities, art, combos,
  and flavor text. </li><li> Over 110,000 words of dialogue with multiple scenarios
  depending on your win/loss record. </li><li> More than 13 different elementary school
