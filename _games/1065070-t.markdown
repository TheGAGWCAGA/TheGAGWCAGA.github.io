about: <strong>Été</strong> [pronounced /ay·tay/, French for &quot;summer&quot;] is
  a relaxing painting game made for people who love exploration and creativity. Step
  into the shoes of a budding painter who travels abroad to Montreal for a summer.
  Unleash color with your paintbrush to freely explore the city and capture its everyday
  wonders on canvas. Befriend locals by fulfilling their inspiring commissions or
  prepare an original expo in your very own art studio.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><h2
  class="bb_tag"><strong>Explore</strong> Montreal in the summer</h2>Use gorgeous
  watercolor to paint the world in 3D and reveal its wonders. Roam around peaceful
  open city scenes and bring them to life by filling them with color.<br><img class="bb_img"

  you discover while exploring — from flowers to birds — is added to your album, an
  ever-growing compendium of stamps that you can then mix and match in your artworks.

  /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Show off</strong> your talent</h2>Some NPCs will commission
  you with inspiring requests for specific artworks, but you're also free to paint
  as many unrestricted creative artworks as you like. Those artworks can then be hung
  on your walls or auctioned at the local café... and maybe, if you get famous enough,
  be exhibited in your very own exposition.<br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1065070/extras/Header_Gallery.gif?t=1731731430"

reviews: "“Été is a sincere, optimistic game that reminds us that it’s never too late
  to start again. Even when it seems impossible to uproot ourselves from our current
  situations, we can always find a way to make a new home anywhere we land. A blank
  canvas doesn’t have to be intimidating; it’s an opportunity.”<br>Giovanni Colantonio,
  Digital Trends<br><br>“Été is less about the process of making art on a canvas,
  and more about making players feel as if they are making the world more beautiful.
  It lets you make art without any of the friction.”<br>Vincent Acovino, The Guardian<br><br>“Été
  [is] an experience that celebrates the beauty in everyday life. A chance to pause,
  reflect and savor the quiet moments. The developers at Impossible strived to immerse
  players into the game, and they hit the ball out of the park.”<br>10/10 – Bright
