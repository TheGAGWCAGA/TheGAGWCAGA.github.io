As a '90s kid from a challenging background, I’ve always been drawn to gritty, dystopian settings and flawed characters.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a deeply personal project, with a lot of myself exposed in an exaggerated and pulp dressing and an atmosphere that embodies a dark expression of fatalism and hopelessness, the overall setting is inspired by neo-noir films and psychological dramas such as Hitchcock's Vertigo, Park's Oldboy and Scorsese's Taxi Driver. For the visuals and pacing of the story, I've drawn a lot from movies like Argento's Suspiria, Lynch's Blue Velvet and Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The setting may sound nihilistic but, at its core, Gloomy Juncture leans into common issues and I'm trying to explore themes of mental health, obsession, violence, guilt and human struggles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For gameplay, I want to recreate the experience of getting lost in a classic graphic adventure yearning to see &quot;what's next&quot;. Games like Grim Fandango and Broken Sword were key inspirations for the core mechanics, while titles such as Tomb Raider (1996) and Hotel Dusk: Room 215 influenced the puzzle-solving. The gritty, noir atmosphere, on the other hand, is inspired from games like Max Payne and The Wolf Among Us.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Setting the game in the '90s felt natural, aligning both with the classic adventure gameplay I'm evoking and the visual style inspired by early 3D and N64-era. By hand-drawing the world on paper, Gloomy Juncture creates a distinctive aesthetic that's both nostalgic and fresh, resulting in a unique visual experience.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Prepare to step into an unsettling world with fragments of a feverish dream driven by obsession.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839980/extras/GIF_Steam_Key-Gameplay-min.gif?t=1732762840\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>PULL LEVERS, PUSH BUTTONS, AND SOLVE ENVIRONMENTAL ENIGMAS</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The core gameplay revolves around gathering items, interacting with the environment, and solving increasingly complex puzzles that evolve in scale and complexity as the narrative progresses.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Gloomy Juncture features a variety of unique puzzle types:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Traditional up-close logic challenges</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Large-scale environmental puzzles requiring careful observation</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Dynamic events and feverish dream sequences</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Action-packed puzzles demanding both brains and brawn</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> 'Boss' puzzle encounters with real-time pattern recognition</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There's no repetition in puzzle design; each one is unique, keeping you engaged and challenged throughout your journey.

As a '90s kid from a challenging background, I’ve always been drawn to gritty, dystopian settings and flawed characters.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a deeply personal project, with a lot of myself exposed in an exaggerated and pulp dressing and an atmosphere that embodies a dark expression of fatalism and hopelessness, the overall setting is inspired by neo-noir films and psychological dramas such as Hitchcock's Vertigo, Park's Oldboy and Scorsese's Taxi Driver. For the visuals and pacing of the story, I've drawn a lot from movies like Argento's Suspiria, Lynch's Blue Velvet and Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The setting may sound nihilistic but, at its core, Gloomy Juncture leans into common issues and I'm trying to explore themes of mental health, obsession, violence, guilt and human struggles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For gameplay, I want to recreate the experience of getting lost in a classic graphic adventure yearning to see &quot;what's next&quot;. Games like Grim Fandango and Broken Sword were key inspirations for the core mechanics, while titles such as Tomb Raider (1996) and Hotel Dusk: Room 215 influenced the puzzle-solving. The gritty, noir atmosphere, on the other hand, is inspired from games like Max Payne and The Wolf Among Us.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Setting the game in the '90s felt natural, aligning both with the classic adventure gameplay I'm evoking and the visual style inspired by early 3D and N64-era. By hand-drawing the world on paper, Gloomy Juncture creates a distinctive aesthetic that's both nostalgic and fresh, resulting in a unique visual experience.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Prepare to step into an unsettling world with fragments of a feverish dream driven by obsession.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839980/extras/GIF_Steam_Key-Gameplay-min.gif?t=1732762840\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>PULL LEVERS, PUSH BUTTONS, AND SOLVE ENVIRONMENTAL ENIGMAS</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The core gameplay revolves around gathering items, interacting with the environment, and solving increasingly complex puzzles that evolve in scale and complexity as the narrative progresses.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Gloomy Juncture features a variety of unique puzzle types:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Traditional up-close logic challenges</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Large-scale environmental puzzles requiring careful observation</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Dynamic events and feverish dream sequences</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Action-packed puzzles demanding both brains and brawn</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> 'Boss' puzzle encounters with real-time pattern recognition</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There's no repetition in puzzle design; each one is unique, keeping you engaged and challenged throughout your journey. Creatively use items to distract and confuse NPCs, or uncover alternative solutions to puzzles with hidden items scattered throughout the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The player character will also react to your actions in real-time; this 'noirish' dynamic narration enriches the experience and provides minimal diegetic tips—your only help for the journey.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Expect challenging puzzles seamlessly blending exploration, problem-solving and immersive storytelling.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839980/extras/GJ_Poster-lowres.jpg?t=1732762840\" /></p>"

reviews: "“A puzzle game in a chaotic world that calls in for your sanity. Solving puzzles is about restoring order. However, in this work, the paradoxical puzzle feeling of being drawn deeper into a person's world of madness the more puzzles you solve is very appealing. Furthermore, the fact that it is done by a single developer drawing for the first time and using those drawings directly into the game brings a new shake-up to the somewhat stagnating indie game world, making it the most controversial work in the history of BitSummit, depicting a fascinating decadence with a sort of outsider art feel.”<br>Professor Iida Kazutoshi, Game Designer from Ritsumeikan University @ BitSummit Drift 2024<br><br>“It's an incredibly cool art style, isn't it? All the textures are done by a single person. The development company consists of one guy and one cat, making a new type of point &amp; click in the first person. This is a mystery game set in a noir world with a unique style, where you experience the inside of someone’s mental state.”<br>Swery (Hidetaka Suehiro) - Top 5 Favorite Games @ BitSummit Drift 2024<br>"
