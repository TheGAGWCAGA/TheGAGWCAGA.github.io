  /><br><br>Master the world's secrets over many short playthroughs (30-90 minutes)

  /><br><br>Upheaval is heavily inspired by tabletop RPGs. Choice and consequence
  are at the heart of all the design decisions.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Incredibly
  replayable! Complete each adventure in 30-90 minutes. Play multiple times to learn
  more about the world and explore thousands of different procedurally randomized
  adventures.<br></li><li> Dynamic! Non-player characters (both friends and enemies)
  are living, moving people for you to respond to and interact with, not just static
  encounters waiting for you to find them.<br></li><li> Every game ends differently!
  The world changes between games, so your adventure will never be the same, even
  if you make the same choices each game. Enemies, NPCs, and treasures are all randomized,
  and each one has specialized interactions with the others. The same actions in one
  game may have different consequences in another.<br></li><li> Accessible! Complete
  text-to-speech and audio description for blind and vision impaired players, plus
  many other accessibility features. To activate text-to-speech, press Shift + T on
  a keyboard, or Left stick button + Right stick button on a controller. Full accessibility
  info is in the &quot;View the manual&quot; link on the Steam sidebar, or on the
  official game website.<br></li><li> Command line version! Play like it's 1980 with
  the command line version, no graphics required (use the &quot;Command Line&quot;
  launch option to access it). The command line version is compatible with screen
  readers and other command-line-compatible software such as auto-translators.<br></li><li>
  You can't die! Failure doesn't mean death in Upheaval; there's always a way forward,
  even if it's not the way you wanted to go. If you get yourself into trouble, you'll
  just have to get out of it.<br></li><li> Relaxed Mode! Turn off the in-game time
  limit and explore the world at your own pace and discover everything it has to offer.
  (Available in the full game only, not in the demo.)<br></li><li> The Magician's
  Shrine! Use a set of immersive, in-universe cheats to adjust the game's difficulty
  however you like. Play the game your way. (Available in the full game only, not
  in the demo.)<br></li><li> Lore! A rich history surrounds your little village, its
  secrets hidden in the beautiful and treacherous landscape around it. Discover how
  magic has affected the land in generations past. How will your knowledge of the
  past influence your decisions today?<br></li><li> Treasure! Over 15 magical and
  mundane treasures and items for you to find and use, each of which can be used in
  multiple different ways.<br></li><li> Fantasy! Goblins, bandits, spells, curses,
  undead spirits, faeries, visions, true love, and more!<br></li><li> Choose from
  eight different starting quests to add variety to each run. All quests are available
  to you every game, no matter which starting quest you choose, but the starting quest
  you choose allows you to get a head start on one quest. Each game includes the same
  twelve big quests, each with multiple ways of completing them and different consequences
  for each strategy that depend on the situation the world is in when you do it.<br></li><li>
  The full game will contain all the same content as the demo, but will allow you
  to play for an additional 15+ in-game days per adventure. It will also include an

  how your choices will affect the world beyond the end of your adventure.</li></ul>
