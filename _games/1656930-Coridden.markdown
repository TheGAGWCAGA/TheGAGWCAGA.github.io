  games together as a hobby</strong>. The project that we now call Coridden, started
  with a simple idea: an interactive co-op moment where one player is steering and
  attacking as a fierce beast, the other riding on the beast''s back and shooting
  enemies around them. <br><br>As we spent more and more time on this idea, and the
  ambitious grew, we decided to <strong>officially start the Aftnareld studio in 2018</strong>
  and shift our game-development hobby to a professional level. We knew from the start
  we wanted to make cooperative games. We believe that <strong>co-op games are not
  only fun, but are also important for bringing people together</strong>!  Along the
  way, we’ve had the fortune to meet several passionate people wanting to help and
  join us on this journey. Today we’re a small team of eager people working hard on
  creating Coridden.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1656930/extras/Header.png?t=1729684119"
