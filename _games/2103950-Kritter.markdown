  is a top-down roguelite combining hack ''n'' slash and base-building elements. Playable
  solo or with up to 4 players online, the goal is to defend your spaceship against
  enemy hordes and gather the necessary resources to repair it.<h2 class="bb_tag">YOUR
  KRITTER, YOUR HERO</h2>You embody a Kritter, a type of combat robot created by M.Ark,
  your spaceship. You have complete control over your Kritter: you will need to juggle
  between your main weapon, heavy weapon, and constructions to protect M.Ark and attempt
  to escape this hostile planet.<h2 class="bb_tag">CHOOSE YOUR GAMEPLAY</h2><img class="bb_img"
  src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2103950/extras/Engineer-ezgif.com-optimize.gif?t=1729796377"
  /><br>Your Kritter adapts to your playstyle! You can opt for different classes that
  drastically change the gameplay. Currently, the game features 3 classes:<br><br><ul
  class="bb_ul"><li><strong>The Defender</strong>: In this form, your Kritter fights
  in melee combat with a sword. It can leap into the air and crash down on groups
  of enemies. The Defender can also build a scarecrow to distract and lure monsters
  wherever desired. The Defender is sturdy and can construct solid stone walls.<br></li><li><strong>The
  Engineer</strong>: Your Kritter fights here at mid-range with a flamethrower. A
  true war machine, the Engineer also shoots sharp nuts around him. It can place turrets
  that automatically target your opponents. The Engineer is more fragile than its
  counterparts but more destructive.<br></li><li><strong>The Tracker</strong>: Your
  Kritter wields a sniper rifle here; the Tracker can take down targets from kilometers
  away. It also has a mortar shot for area damage and can place mines along its path
  to greet those foolish enough to follow. The Tracker creates barriers that its shots
  can pass through. Handy!</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>AN ADVENTURE IN THREE
  PHASES</strong></h2><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2103950/extras/Construction.gif?t=1729796377"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">A TIME TO DEFEND</h2>During a game, monsters will surge towards
  your spaceship in &quot;waves&quot;. Each time you survive a wave, you''ll earn
  a reward to evolve your Kritter. Will you upgrade one of your attacks? Heal yourself?
  Opt for more resources? Each game is unique, and your choice will be crucial.<h2
  class="bb_tag">A TIME TO EXPLORE</h2>Between monster waves, you''ll have a brief
  respite. This will be your chance to explore the surroundings in search of valuable
  resources needed to build defenses or improve your Kritter''s statistics. However,
  beware, as this respite will be short-lived! Always keep an eye on the timer because
  when it reaches 0... Another wave will hit. Don''t leave M.Ark defenseless.<h2 class="bb_tag">A
  TIME TO PREPARE</h2>After exploration and defense, you''ll have resources at hand.
  You can then decide how to spend them: Will you create deadly traps? Build upgrade
  modules? Construct destructive turrets around your spaceship to help fend off the
  next wave?<h2 class="bb_tag">AN OVERWHELMING THREAT</h2><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2103950/extras/Roguelike-steam.gif?t=1729796377"
  /><br>Despite your efforts, it''s highly likely that defeat will occur at some point.
  M.Ark will then rewind time, bringing you back to its cockpit, and everything will
  need to be done again... Well, almost everything! You''ll be able to upgrade your
  Kritter or M.Ark between games using soul crystals! These major upgrades will make
  life easier for you: adding a shield around M.Ark, adding a radar to know where
  enemies are coming from, enhancing your strength, boosting your resources, increasing
  your life... The choices are numerous!<h2 class="bb_tag">A STORY THAT UNFOLDS OVER
  TIME</h2>Kritter is a story of time. When you lose, you rewind time; when you play,
  you battle against time... The story itself unfolds within this temporal chaos.
  M.Ark is the narrator of the story... But M.Ark suffers from amnesia! With each
  defeat, with each return to its cockpit, the story will progress. It is through
  advancing that M.Ark will gradually remember the reason for our presence here.<h2
  class="bb_tag">DYING IS MORE FUN TOGETHER</h2><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2103950/extras/Multij-steam.gif?t=1729796377"
  /><br>Kritter is a demanding game that will require you to face death more than
  once... So what''s better than facing it together? Invite your friends, form squads
  of up to 4 players, and discover the exciting story of Kritter in cooperative play!'
