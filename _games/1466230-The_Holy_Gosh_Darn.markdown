To do that, you'll harness the power of time travel by using a mysterious magical clock given to you by Death. Jump freely between past and present as you uncover secrets across Heaven, Hell, Earth, and Helheim. Insights from the future could accelerate events in the past, so make every second count!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466230/extras/en_StoreGifs_2.gif?t=1732659163\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Holy Gosh Darn is a riotous narrative adventure built around time-travel as a core mechanic. Wield your trusty time-traveling watch and hop any point during the day, uncovering the secrets of a mysterious artifact created by God himself. Along the way, you'll meet a hilarious cast of characters and explore ever-shifting locations as you try to prevent an army of Phantoms from overrunning heaven. Which is really annoying, because you live there.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466230/extras/en_StoreGifs_1.gif?t=1732659163\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This hilarious action-adventure blends time travel with Metroidvania progression, inventive puzzles and over-the-top set pieces. The Holy Gosh Darn will answer life's most burning questions - like why time travel makes you barf, why why swearing is reserved for angels, and why it's completely fine to rudely skip dialogue when you're racing against the clock to save Heaven. The trilogy of The Holy Gosh Darn, Manual Samuel and Helheim Hassle might all be in the same universe, but they can be played in any order you like!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466230/extras/en_StoreGifPairs_4.gif?t=1732659163\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Prepare for outrageous humor, brain-tickling puzzles, and a chaotic adventure that'll keep you grinning from start to finish!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Over 6.5 hours of fully voiced dialogue - One dedicated “Shut up” button that can skip it all!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Time travel game for everyone, even if you hate time travel games</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Sprint, dash and jump through the afterlife as you uncover secrets across both space AND time!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unique time-pressured narrative requires players to hurry along NPCs as they uncover new information.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Uncover fresh narrative strands which are triggered by progression, time, space and logic.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">23 Heavenly Elders to insult!
