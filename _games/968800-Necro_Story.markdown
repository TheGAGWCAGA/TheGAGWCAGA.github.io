title: Necro Story
description: Necro Story is a creature-collection RPG where you play as a (kind of)
  evil necromancer more into undead shenanigans than saving the world! Command quirky
  minions, outsmart foes, and snag their souls to power up your team. Expect strategic
  combat, laughs, and plenty of mischief.
