title: "Quantum Witch"
description: "Wake up lovely, you've got things to do! First, find your lost flock of faer. Then find your wife, she'd look so cute wearing that flower you found. And if you have time, attack and dethrone god. Ok? Don't worry about that portal. I'm sure it's nothing. Now be careful. Every choice matters."
