reviews: "“Love, Ghostie is an adorable little matchmaking game filled with wholesome
  humour and amusing roommate shenanigans. Filled with fun mini-games and interesting
  characters, you’ll easily spend hours invested in shipping each one.”<br>9.5/10
  – GameGrin<br><br>“Love, Ghostie is a warm hug after a long day. The visuals are
  charming, with each character designed to be as endearing as possible. The game’s
  music and sound effects are equally delightful, adding to the overall sense of comfort
  and relaxation.”<br>9/10 – Gaming Cypher<br><br>“Love, Ghostie is basically a game
  for folks who play games like Fire Emblem or The Sims because they want to pair
  characters up in relationships. It’s incredibly compelling! ... It’s also got a
  ton of replay value, even though there are only 12 characters, since they can all
  get together.”<br>8.5/10 – Siliconera<br>"
