reviews: "“Roots of Yggdrasil is a good spin on the roguelike genre, and one that should appeal to those who typically shy away from its trappings. It’s combination of city-building and card-based deckbuilding make it both inviting and forgiving, while remaining challenging.”<br>8/10 – Gaming Nexus<br><br>“Roots of Yggdrasil is a refreshing and engaging gaming experience that brilliantly combines elements of strategy, management, and roguelike.”<br>7.5/10 – BetaTesteur<br><br>“Roots of Yggdrasil is a very intuitive and addictive game. It hits the perfect balance of challenging but rewarding.”<br>8.4/10 – Screen Hype<br>"
