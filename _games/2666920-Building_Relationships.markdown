title: Building Relationships
description: Experience life as a house in this silly adventure game! Play as a building
  as you roll, jump, and wave-dash across a cozy island. Meet eligible structures,
  romance them, and experience a bizarre, yet oddly familiar story.. or go fishing
  instead (though we replaced fish with cars to make more sense)

reviews: "“The whole vibe here is 'charmingly awkward,' and Building Relationships
  seems like it's managed to avoid feeling like it's simply weird for weirdness's
  sake.”<br>GamesRadar+<br><br>“At the heart of it all, the dialogue in Building Relationships
  is gearing up to be quite special, mimicking online conventions with tons of personality.”<br>Paste

  it and underneath was an article that was intriguing and also made no sense.”<br>from
