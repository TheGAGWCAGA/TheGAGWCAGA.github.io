reviews: "“Satire is finally an effective means of countering the ubiquitous Russian
  information warriors. The Russian troll will be defeated at its own game. This is
  nothing new: Charlie Chaplin made fun of Adolf Hitler in a film back in 1940, when
  the world war was raging. Today, &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; is considered a
  masterpiece”<br>Der Standard<br><br>“This is a controversial game that brings politics
  in games together in an uncomfortable way, and Lesser makes no apologies for that.”<br>VentureBeat<br><br>“I
  can't help but feel that the developer's message is that humane treatment of the
  enemy and peaceful resistance are more important than fighting”<br>Gamespark<br>"
