about: 'Inspector Waffles Early Days is the prequel of Inspector Waffles, the adventure/detective
  game released in 2021. This new game was made for Game Boy Color, and is also available
  for PC! <br><br><br><br>This time, follow a younger Waffles, a cunning and witty
  cat, in his first days as an Inspector who wants to prove to everyone that he is
  more than just a rookie. Your partner, Pancakes, is an experienced Inspector and
  probably the only one at the police station that isn’t an incompetent policecat.
  <br><br>With this top-tier team, catching bad guys could sound easy, but beware…
