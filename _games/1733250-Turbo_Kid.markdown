reviews: "“Out of nowhere, Turbo Kid is an immediate candidate for one of the all-time
  best entries in the Metroidvania genre ... Its period-perfect presentation, both
  visually and thanks to a brilliant chiptune soundtrack, is meticulously crafted,
  and an absolute delight to get lost in. Turbo Kid's secret origin may be ultra-cult,
  but this game deserves a veritable box office breakthrough.”<br>4/5 – Empire<br><br>“We
  tried the game on Steam Deck ... it runs extremely well on the platform. And this
  makes it a perfect addition for your Steam games. Overall, Turbo Kid ... brings
  some interesting gameplay that I have not experienced in a platformer game before.”<br>9/10
  – Gaming Cypher<br><br>“Turbo Kid is an awesome bike-based Metroidvania, with fun
  combat, great locomotion, and loads of hidden treasures to find. Using your bike
  to get around and launch yourself to secret passages never gets old, and the gory
  apocalyptic setting is a joy to explore.”<br>8.5/10 – God is a Geek<br>"
