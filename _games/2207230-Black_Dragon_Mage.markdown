  notes:
about: <strong>Black Dragon Mage</strong> is a gorgeous <strong>dark fantasy, action-roguelite,
  top-down shooter</strong> with elements from the <i>bullet heaven</i> subgenre (<i>aka
  &quot;survivors-like&quot;</i>), featuring 16 bit style retro visuals and <strong><i>thousands
  </i>of relentless demonic enemies</strong>, challenging <strong>boss fights</strong>
  and satisfying <strong>build variety</strong>.<h2 class="bb_tag">Become the Black
  Dragon Mage</h2><strong>Hatch your very own dragon companion</strong> from an egg

  /><br><br><strong>Upgrade your mage &amp; weapons</strong> on every level-up and
  pick a unique combination of <strong>ARPG-style abilities</strong> for your run.
  Every death is a new opportunity to experiment and grow your might! Buy new <strong>meta-upgrades</strong>
  (weapons, abilities, upgrades, hats &amp; more!) in the <i>Hall of Relics</i> and
  avenge your own death with newfound power.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2207230/extras/shred.gif?t=1732794558"

  paths called <i>Masteries</i>, to unlock their full strategic potential and build

  /><br><br><strong>Turn the environment to your favor</strong> using your <i>(often
  outrageously explosive!)</i> strategic genius, outmaneuver your foes by leading
  them into deadly traps! Laugh as you watch them hurl across the battlefield... <i>Fools!</i>
  Environments use procedural generation to make sure every run feels fresh, with
  randomly placed power-ups and hazards spread across the maps.
