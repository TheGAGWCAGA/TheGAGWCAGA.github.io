about: Automate a team of robots to gather resources, scale up production, reshape
  terrain, and expand your colony on a procedurally generated alien world.<h2 class="bb_tag">Explore
  a procedural world</h2>Every game you are exploring a different planet, with a different
  set of resources and biomes that present unique challenge. You start able to only
  see a small area, but as you progress you build out a radio network and unlock more
  of the world. <br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2613890/extras/Montage.gif?t=1729356745"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Collect resources</h2>Expanding your colony requires ever increasing
  quantity of resources. Luckily, the planet you're on is ripe with them to find and
  use. <br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2613890/extras/Mine2.gif?t=1729356745"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Automate Everything</h2>Anything you can do you can automate.
  It becomes a necessity as your colony grows larger, and recipes get more complex.

  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Reshape the Terrain</h2>As the resources near your base run
  dry, you need to look farther to continue expansion. Build roads, pathways, quarries,
  bridges, and other structures to extract and transport materials. <br><img class="bb_img"
