  /><br>Stig is a single-player puzzle game about finding a path through colors. The
  objective of the game is to walk on colored tiles in an order that matches a given
  pattern. As you progress through the levels, more and more mechanics are introduced,
  keeping the puzzle solving experience varied and fresh.<br><br><img class="bb_img"

  /><br>The controls in the game are simple. All you need in order to navigate the
  puzzles is to move up, down, left, and right. If you ever make a mistake there is
  an undo and a restart button as well, which might come in handy during some of the
  trickier levels.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Key features</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
