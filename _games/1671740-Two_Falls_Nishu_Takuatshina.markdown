about: <i>Two Falls (Nishu Takuatshina)</i> is a first-person single player, narrative-driven
  experience that presents contrasting perspectives on French and Indigenous first
  encounters. Be prepared to face the dangers of Canadian wilderness and to make choices
  that could affect your characters.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1671740/extras/3.gif?t=1732568482"
  /><br><br>Explore 17th century Canadian wilderness in this 3D linear game and experience
  the intertwining journeys of Jeanne, a French King’s Daughter stranded far from
  the French colonies and Maikan, a young Innu hunter trying to uncover what is disturbing
  his native forest, land of his ancestors.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1671740/extras/Titre1.png?t=1732568482"
  /><br>Jeanne is a strong-willed French woman who set sail to the colonies of Nouvelle-France,
  hoping to start a better life overseas. After her ship runs aground, she and the
  dog Capitaine emerge as its sole survivors. Forced to weather the dangers of Canada’s
  uncharted wilderness, her faith in God will be tested as she makes her way to Quebec.
  Will she remain a Saint in the face of impossible odds? Or commit grave sins for
  the sake of survival?<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1671740/extras/characters_sm_2.png?t=1732568482"
  /><br>A young hunter-gatherer from an isolated Innu community, Maikan is the great-grandson
  of a medicine man, and has never known what life was before the arrival of white
  men. After discovering a sinister phenomenon that threatens the future of his people,
  he sets off on a journey west, hoping to uncover the mystery behind the land’s defilement.
  Tradition will guide his path through unfamiliar wilderness. But nothing can prepare
  him for first contact with the outsiders.<br><br><i><strong>Will you dare to experience

  /><br>As you play through <i>Two Falls</i>, you'll uncover the distinct realities
  and cultures of Jeanne and Maikan, each with their unique perspective on life. With
  two distinct artistic and musical directions, you'll interpret the events from their
  points of view and discover that a single event can have vastly different meanings
  for each character. <br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1671740/extras/BeachPerspectives.gif?t=1732568482"
  /><br><br>The game's mechanics serve the story, with detective-like scene inspections
  and exploration of unique 17th-century environments. With each decision, you'll
  be drawn deeper into the story, questioning your own beliefs and becoming fully
  immersed in the historical inspirations of the game.<br><br><img class="bb_img"

  /><br>While the story of <i>Two Falls</i> follows a linear path, your choices and
  actions within the game will have an impact on how Jeanne and Maikan evolve throughout
  their journey. As they come to terms with the upheaval of their familiar world,
  you'll feel their struggles and triumphs in a deeply immersive experience.<br><br><img
